            Every year, Google hosts a global competition called the Solution Challenge, aligned with the UN's 17
            Sustainable Development Goals. The winners receive significant prizes and numerous opportunities.
            Registration for the Solution Challenge typically begins around mid-February.
            Our Hackathon follows the same theme, participants can enhance their projects and potentially join the
            global competition. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals can be found on the official UN website: <a
